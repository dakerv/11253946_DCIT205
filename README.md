# DCIT_205_IA
</br>

**Student ID:** 11253946
</br>

**INTRODUCTION** </br>
My name is Vanessa Elinam Daker, an IT student of the university of Ghana. The purpose of this website is to facilitate easy access to information for current and prospective students within the computer science department.
Information for prospective students, concerning what will be their areas of study over the duration of their degree program, what is expected of them, resources, events among others. The website also allows students to know be familiar with their department heads and seniors. (Staff Profiles)

**THE PROCESS** </br>

I rebuilt the website from scratch, using a different design. I envisioned something simple but attractive and interactive enough,
using CSS, HTML and JavaScript. I did take some of the information from the official site, however, it was text only.

**HOME PAGE** </br>

For my first page, I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I used CSS to design the page's template. I gave colors, alignment, margins and even transition colors to my sections, navigators and body and headers. I also used that to hide texts, make my 'feature-box' and edit images. </br>

I used HTML to add images and fill the feature boxes with information. JavaScript, I used for the click action that would reveal the text, using 'toggle text' and for other animations as well. Then I made my footer.

**RESOURCES PAGE**</br>

The resource page contains information, tools and links to practical resources. In CSS, I made a grid, and applied a reasonable gap between my containers.
Each of my resource cards came with the same padding of 20px to define the space between the element and the border, giving it a sleek finish. I also added some transitions with JavaScript, so that everything does not look too basic.

For my HTML, I made sections and used dividers, along with classes. This was to provide adequate spacing. My classes "resource-card" was to create a consistent visual style for each of the cards.

**STUDENT'S SHOWCASE**</br>

The purpose of this webpage is to display projects done by current and past students of the department. I put three of the "best" works on display.

I started out with my usual CSS code, that I have been using for most of my pages so far. Then, I made project cards, with project images within each card. I then created a header and some selecters to edit the header message. JavaScript took care of the animations.

Then I proceeded to add all the information inside the cards with HTML. I finished the page off with my usual footer.

**CATALOGUE** </br>
The catalogue of this website shows a few of the courses offered at the computer science department in year two. For this page, I decided to use my JavaScript. I hid the content from the user at first sit by using list-style-type: none;. Then using JavaScript, with "onclick", the user gets the list beneath each subject after clicking. I listed every item under the subject in an bulleted points inside an unordered list. Then, I cloned my footer from previous page, and most of my CSS.

**STAFF SPOTLIGHT** </br>

The purpose of the webpage is to showcase the faculty of the computer science department, along with their positions.  

My staff spotlight page is virtually identical to the student showcase, only with different colour grading. I used "staff cards" whose design were very similar to the project card design of the previous page. In them, I linked images of all the lecturers easily available on the internet. And then, I added my usual footer.

**ABOUT PAGE**</br>

The about page simply consists of a few sections in containers that give information about the department. I used dividers to separate the content.
For my footer, I added contact information and links to social media profiles using lists both ordered and unordered.
