# DCIT_205_IA
**INTRODUCTION**
My name is Vanessa Elinam Daker, an IT student of the university of Ghana.
Student ID: 11253946
The purpose of this website is to facilitate easy access to information for currents and prospective students within the computer science department.
Information for prospective students, concerning what is their areas of study over the duration of their degree program, what is expected of them, resources, events among others.
The website also allows students to know and interact with the relevant people to help them with problems they may face (through the Contact page and Staff Profiles)

**THE PROCESS**
I rebuilt the website from scratch, using a different design. I envisioned something simple but attractive and interactive enough.
Using CSS, HTML and JavaScript.

**HOME PAGE**
 I created a header with an image. And then, I made some navigation bars that take the user to the relevant text when clicked, using Javascript. The text has a fade-in animation. 
 I also added relevant images in each of the sections, and then used the <a><href> elements and attributes respectivily to guide the user.

**ABOUT PAGE**

The about page simply consists of a few sections in containers that give information about the department. I used dividers to separate the content.
For my footer, I added contact information and links to social media profiles using lists both ordered and unordered. 

**RESOURCES PAGE**

The resource page contains information, tools and links to practical resources. In CSS, I made a grid, and applied a reasonable gap between my containers.
Each of my resource cards came with the same padding of 20px to define the space between the element and the border, giving it a sleek finish. I also added some transitions, so that everything does not look too basic.

For my HTML, I made sections and used dividers, along with classes. This was to provide adequate spacing. My classes "resource-card" was to create a consistent visual style for each of the cards.

**STUDENT'S SHOWCASE**

The purpose of this webpage is to display projects done by current and past students of the department. I put three of the [best] works on display.

I started out with my usual CSS code, that I have been using for most of my pages so far. Then, I used project cards, with project images within each card. I then created a header and some selecters to edit the header message.

Then I proceeded to add all the information inside the cards. I finished the page off with my usual footer.

**STAFF SPOTLIGHT**
The purpose of the webpage is to showcase the faculty of the computer science department, along with their positions.  

My staff spotlight page is virtually identical to the student showcase, only with different colour grading. I used "staff cards" whose design were very similar to the project card design of the previous page. In them, I linked images of all the lecturers easily available on the internet. And then, I added my usual footer.
